## Overview
This university project aims to predict brain stroke occurrences using a publicly available dataset. Our objective is twofold: to replicate the methodologies and findings of the research paper ["Stroke Risk Prediction with Machine Learning Techniques"](https://doi.org/10.3390/s22134670) and to implement an alternative version using best practices in machine learning and data analysis.

### Project Structure
- **Paper Replication**: Adhering closely to the methodologies and approaches detailed in the referenced paper.
- **Best Practices Implementation**: Incorporating contemporary best practices to enhance model performance, robustness, and reproducibility.

### Key Highlights
- **Data Source**: Publicly available stroke prediction dataset from Kaggle.
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Implementation of various ML algorithms including Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and more.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation using AUC, precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy.
